        "The problem of the research was the <strong>unsatisfactory usability of handheld and contextual menus</strong> designed for Virtual Reality. Based on analyzed scientific publications, we discovered that menus with higher potency to support <strong>immersive experience</strong> are in general worse in terms of usability (like 3D or handheld menus). Our goal was to <strong>design and test 2 new types of menus</strong> supporting immersion and compare them with a traditional flat menu manipulated by a pointer. We conducted <strong>10 tests</strong>.",
