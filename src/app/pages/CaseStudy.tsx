The solution was designed so that users wouldn't be able to proceed with a critical mistake. However, they should be able to proceed with a non-critical issue, unless they had accumulated too many of them. We <strong>set up a threshold for the number of acceptable non-critical issues</strong>, as well as a mechanism to inform the users about the <strong>overall score of the document</strong>.

To decrease the chance of reporting the mistake just to be able to ignore validation, the copy suggested that each report will be <strong>checked for improving the accuracy of the solution</strong> - and that wasn't a lie, we wanted to see these reports, quantify them, and act upon them." },
