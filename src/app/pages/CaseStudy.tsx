Feedback, not autocorrect.</strong> Together with the business stakeholders we took a decision to rather inform users what mistakes they have done and ask them for the \"manual\" improvement, rather than provide an autocorrect or text to paste. Primarily because the most likely AI wouldn't have a good source of truth. The other aspect was that we wanted users to feel the personal responsibility for the content, which we felt would be diminished if AI replaced them with figuring out the content. Whenever a mistake happened, the solution highlighted the paragraphs with the issues, and users were asked to address a specific issue." },

Once the field is evaluated by the AI, users would receive a gentle notification in the corner of the screen." },

For example, imprecise language shouldn't be treated the same way as inputing \"lorem ipsum\" content. That's why I proposed classifying mistakes into two categories: critical mistake and non-critical issue. The solution was designed so that users wouldn't be able to proceed with a critical mistake. However, they should be able to proceed with a non-critical issue, unless they accumulated too many of them. We set up a threshold for the number of acceptable non-critical issues, as well as a mechanism to inform the users about the overall score of the document. Users could check their score ad hoc, but also they would be informed about the score before marking the document as completed." },
      { type: "p", html: "<strong>5. Reporting AI mistakes.</strong> Though we felt like we exhausted the list of potential issues, we couldn't be 100% sure. Also, we had to count with the AI hallucination scenarios. Therefore, I designed the mechanism to report a mistake of the validation agent. Whenever a user reported a specific suggestion as invalid, this specific criterion wouldn't be checked ever again against the text provided for the input. To decrease the chance of reporting the mistake just to be able to ignore validation, the copy suggested that each report will be checked for improving the accuracy of the solution — and that wasn't a lie, we wanted to see these reports, quantise them, and act upon them." },

The proposed solution used AI to provide feedback, telling users what mistakes they made and how to mitigate them, rather than automatically re-writing the content, ensuring people rely on their own information.
