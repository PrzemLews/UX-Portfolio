The proposed solution used <strong>AI to provide feedback, telling users what mistakes they made</strong> and how to mitigate them, <strong>rather than automatically re-writing the content</strong>, ensuring people rely on their own information. I <strong>designed high-level sketches in Figma</strong>; later they were <strong>reviewed by both the business owner and AI developers to validate feasibility</strong>.
